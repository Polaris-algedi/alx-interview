# UTF-8 Validation

## Introduction
This project aims to implement a UTF-8 validation algorithm. The UTF-8 encoding is a variable-length character encoding that can represent any Unicode character. The goal is to validate whether a given byte sequence is a valid UTF-8 encoded string.

## Features
- Validate UTF-8 encoded byte sequences
- Handle different UTF-8 encoding rules and edge cases
- Provide error handling for invalid byte sequences
- Support for both ASCII and non-ASCII characters

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Go to the file location and make sure the file is executable.
3. Run the file using the appropriate command.
